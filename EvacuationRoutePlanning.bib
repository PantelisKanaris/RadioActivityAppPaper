	abstract = {A well-planned evacuation route can help to prevent traffic congestion and reduce the time required for evacuation; however, many existing evacuation route-planning solutions based on real-time traffic conditions fail to consider the degree to which evacuation guidance can exacerbate traffic congestion. This paper proposes an evacuation route-planning algorithm based on predictions of future traffic conditions. The proposed scheme tries to find evacuation routes out of a given disaster area such that evacuation is completed as fast as possible. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can complete evacuations 18\% faster than {MacroServ}, currently the best evacuation route-planning system.},

	abstract = {Flood is one of the most frequently occurring and devastating disasters in Nepal. Several locations in Nepal are at high risk of flood, which requires proper guidance on early warning and safe evacuation of people to emergency locations through optimal routes to minimize fatalities. However, the information is limited to flood hazard mapping only. This study provides a comprehensive flood susceptibility and evacuation route mapping in the Siraha Municipality of Nepal where a lot of flood events have occurred in the past and are liable to happen in the future. The flood susceptibility map was created using a Geographic Information System ({GIS})-based Analytical Hierarchy Process ({AHP}) over nine flood conditioning factors. It showed that 47\% of the total area was highly susceptible to flood, and the remaining was in the safe zone. The assembly points where people would gather for evacuation were selected within the susceptible zone through manual digitization while the emergency shelters were selected within a safe zone such that they can host the maximum number of people. The network analysis approach is used for evacuation route mapping in which the closest facility analysis proposed the optimum evacuation route based on the walking speed of evacuees to reach the emergency shelter place considering the effect of slope and flood on the speed of the pedestrian. A total of 12 out of 22 suggested emergency shelters were within 30 min, 7 within 60 min, and 2 within 100 min walk from the assembly point. Moreover, this study suggests the possible areas for further shelter place allocations based on service area analysis. This study can support the authorities’ decision-making for the flood risk assessment and early warning system planning, and helps in providing an efficient evacuation plan for risk mitigation.},

A time-varying equivalent weight Dijkstra algorithm ({TVEWDA}) is proposed, combining a fire dynamics simulator ({FDS}) to find optimal evacuation routes in case of a sudden cruise ship fire. First, the {FDS} software is used to simulate a cruise ship's single and multi-source fire scenarios. Second, the Dijkstra algorithm using only distance between nodes is improved by considering the effects of {CO} concentration, visibility, and temperature. The evacuees’ speed is taken into consideration within the {TVEWDA}. The effects of congestion are considered in the evacuees’ moving speed. Finally, the {TVEWDA} and a cruise ship evacuation network model are integrated to develop a real-time evacuation route optimization model. Simulation results show that the evacuation time achieved by the {TVEWDA} is 22\% shorter than that of the Dijkstra algorithm using only distance between nodes and 11\% shorter than that of an improved social force model in the multi-source fire scenario. This approach is well-suited to guide the evacuation of cruise ship evacuees in the event of single-source or multi-source fires, effectively ensuring the safety of passengers and the preservation of their property.},

	abstract = {This study aims to implement the genetic algorithm by testing the appropriate crossover methods in order to obtain optimal disaster evacuation routes based three main indicators, namely travel time, possible transportation mode, and affected road conditions. The research phase begins with establishing a flood-affected area scenario consisting of the victim's initial location, evacuation location, routing areas, affected road conditions, distance, as well as travel time. The genetic algorithm is applied by representing the genes and chromosomes based on the available data, generating the initial population and calculating the fitness value. At the stage of determining the parent in forming a new individual, roulette wheel selection is used. For the crossover method to produce new individuals, there are 3 methods tested namely single-point, two-point and uniform crossover. The new formed individuals are then mutated with a probability level of 0.1. The last stage is to form a new population by sorting individuals with the highest fitness value. These processes took place with an iteration limit of 1000. Based on the results of the implementation and tests conducted, the uniform crossover method has the most optimal results with accuracy 90\% and highest fitness value of 0.896. Meanwhile, the two others methods two-point and single-point have extremely lower accuracy which are 70\% and 60\% respectively. This result confirmed the statement of previous research which convinced that the uniform crossover is the most effective crossover method.},

	abstract = {The Mobile-{GIS} Sister Village Evacuation Route ({MSVER}) system was devised and implemented in order to enhance Yogyakarta’s Mount Merapi eruption mitigation and evacuation. The 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi, with its pyroclastic flows and volcanic ashfall, posed a threat to local residents. In response, the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation ({PVMBG}) issued evacuation orders with variable safe zone radii, necessitating meticulous route planning and communication. This study suggests {MSVER}, which utilizes {GIS} and Sister Villages to address these problems. Using {GIS} on mobile devices, the system provides real-time data on disaster-prone areas, evacuation routes, meeting points, and disaster-resistant villages. The {BPPTKG} provides status updates for Mount Merapi. {MSVER} system development involves establishing optimization criteria for evacuation routes, such as distance, speed, density, and obstacles. The Merapi Evacuation Route app helps users locate danger zones, discover evacuation routes and gathering sites, and comprehend Mount Merapi’s eruption status and risks. It also contains information on the population and disaster-resilient villages. In conclusion, the {MSVER} system employs {GIS} and Sister Villages to assist communities in Yogyakarta in preparing for and responding to Mount Merapi eruptions. This ingenious strategy saves lives and serves as an example of how to use indigenous knowledge and technology to combat natural disasters.},

	abstract = {Route choice is a complex issue in simulating individual behaviors and reproducing collective phenomena during evacuations. A growing concern has been given to the individual cognitive mechanism to investigate how routing decisions are made in specific situations. However, the essential role of multiple spatio-temporal scales has not been completely considered in the current cognitive frameworks, which leads to the inaccuracy of cognition representation in evacuation decisions. This study proposes a novel spatio-temporal cognitive framework integrated with multiple spatio-temporal scales for individual route choice. First, a complete spatio-temporal cognitive mechanism is constructed to depict the individual evacuation cognition process. Second, a spatio-temporal route choice strategy that emerges from agent-based simulation and extends into the spatio-temporal potential field is designed to represent the overall time-varying cost along routes in individual subjective estimation. Finally, a spatio-temporal A* algorithm is developed for individual optimal route planning in complex outdoor evacuation scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperformed the conventional potential field model in evacuation performance, in both objective crowd evacuation evaluation metrics and individual subjectively estimated evacuation cost in cognition, and may provide more insights on crowd evacuation management and guidance.},

	abstract = {The present study aims to propose the method for the quantitative evaluation of safety concerning evacuation routes in case of earthquake disasters in urban areas using Ant Colony Optimization ({ACO}) algorithm and Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}). Regarding the safety evaluation method, ﬁrstly, the similarity in safety was focused on while taking into consideration road blockage probability, and after classifying roads by means of the hierarchical cluster analysis, the congestion rates of evacuation routes using {ACO} simulations were estimated. Based on these results, the multiple evacuation routes extracted were visualized on digital maps by means of {GIS}, and its safety was evaluated. Furthermore, the selection of safe evacuation routes between evacuation sites, for cases when the possibility of large-scale evacuation after an earthquake disaster is high, is made possible. As the safety evaluation method is based on public information, by obtaining the same geographic information as the present study, it is eﬀective in other areas regardless of whether the information is of the past and future. Therefore, in addition to spatial reproducibility, the safety evaluation method also has high temporal reproducibility. Because safety evaluations are conducted on evacuation routes based on quantiﬁed data, highly safe evacuation routes that are selected have been quantitatively evaluated, and thus serve as an eﬀective indicator when selecting evacuation routes.},

The problem is computationally challenging due to the large size of the transportation network and the constraints. Related work has considered the evacuation routing problem either solely as a network flow optimization problem or a conflict minimization problem, but not both.

	abstract = {Given a transportation network, a population, and a set of destinations, the goal of evacuation route planning is to produce routes that minimize the evacuation time for the population. Evacuation planning is essential for ensuring public safety in the wake of man-made or natural disasters (e.g., terrorist acts, hurricanes, and nuclear accidents). The problem is challenging because of the large size of network data, the large number of evacuees, and the need to account for capacity constraints in the road network. Promising methods that incorporate capacity constraints into route planning have been developed but new insights are needed to reduce the high computational costs incurred by these methods with large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable approach that explicitly exploits the spatial structure of road networks to minimize the computational time. Our new approach accelerates the routing algorithm by partitioning the network using dartboard network-cuts and groups node-independent shortest routes to reduce the number of search iterations. Experimental results using a Minneapolis, {MN} road network demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms prior work for {CCRP} computation by orders of magnitude.},

Although immediate evacuation is crucial for protecting individuals, existing evacuation planning tools lack integration with smoke behavior simulations, which limits their effectiveness. This paper introduces s-{ERP} (smoke-based Evacuation Route Planning), a real-time decision-making system designed to enhance evacuation outcomes during wildfire events. s-{ERP} constitutes a cost-efficient integrated framework that analyzes spatiotemporal data by developing synergies with various open external tools to proactively determine both safe evacuation routes and the optimal departure time. This tool comprises three core modules: (i) the Smoke Dispersion Module that forecasts the progress of smoke behavior by adopting a Gaussian plume model; (ii) the Evacuation Route Planning Module that implements an algorithm identifying alternative safe routes, while minimizing exposure to smoke-affected areas; and (iii) the Web Application, consisting of a {RESTful} {API} with multiple endpoints, which manages data flow and enables operational use by stakeholders. The proposed system is validated through extensive experimental evaluations under realistic wildfire and smoke conditions and in the context of a real scenario of distributed emergency management. The empirical findings indicate that s-{ERP} mitigates evacuee exposure to harmful smoke in comparison to conventional methods and improves route reliability under wildfire dynamic conditions. These results demonstrate the system’s capability to deliver timely, adaptive and health-oriented evacuation strategies.},

	abstract = {The extent of casualty and property loss due to chemical accidents depends on how well the emergency action plan was established in advance and how fast the warning notice and evacuation orders are given to the public. Assistant methods for the establishment of protective action plans have been developed for several decades. However, the currently developed decision trees are complicated, so they may require a detailed analysis, and previous decision matrices do not consider the indoor and outdoor concentration directly and hence do not allow a change in evacuation order. In this study, five key parameters, report time, toxic cloud arrival/removal time and indoor/outdoor concentration, are selected for the evacuation decision, and the effectiveness of leakage and wind speed on five parameters is investigated. {CFD} simulations are performed for the various values of mass flow rate and wind speed. Near the release point of toxic gas, the maximum concentration is unaffected by wind speed, but the mass flow rate significantly influences it at low wind speeds. In the far field, the maximum concentration decreases with increasing wind speed. The termination time for shelter-in-place, suggesting a shift to evacuation, decreases with both higher mass flow rate and wind speed. For smaller mass flow rates (m˙=0.1kg/s), indoor concentration exceeds outdoor levels after 25.9 min, while for larger mass flow rates (m˙=2.0kg/s), this time shortens to 15.2 min. Increasing wind speed from 0.5 m/s to 5.0 m/s decreases the equilibrium concentration from 13.9 ppm to 3.4 ppm and reduces the escape time from 48.9 min to 16.0 min. Overall, higher mass flow rates and wind speeds shorten the equilibrium and escape times, improving toxic cloud removal efficiency. Based on the simulation results, a new evacuation decision matrix is developed which minimizes the total exposure concentration. This study provides the proper evacuation time along distance which eventually prevents traffic congestion because of the simultaneous escape rush.},

	abstract = {Safety in nuclear energy utilization is crucial. In the event of a radioactive release incident, coupled with meteorological uncertainties, a radioactive plume can impact personnel evacuation. This paper presents an integrated solution for radionuclide release accident assessment and emergency evacuation decision making. The solution consists of three processes: atmospheric dispersion calculation, dose calculation, and path planning. The individual processes are connected through data exchange, thus allowing users to choose specific models based on experience. The proposed scheme combination is the Gaussian plume model, the dose conversion factor method, and an improved Dijkstra’s path planning algorithm. This algorithm, combined with dispersion and dose results, weighs nodes using the moving expected dose, facilitating the path with minimum dose risk. A program for Atmospheric Diffusion and Dose Calculation ({ADDC}) is developed based on the recommended scheme. Advantages include ease of use, minimal data requirements, data accessibility, and efficient evacuation. Dose estimates and optimal evacuation routes can be obtained quickly and at very low cost in response to rapidly changing environmental conditions. In a case study at a Chinese planned nuclear plant, we consider a spent fuel pool water loss scenario, assessing dose risks from 2020 to 2022 meteorological statistics. In dose calculation, results reveal that during an {SFP} drying accident, the radiation dose in the core area (100 m away) can reach 30–150 {mSv} within 2 h, and at 500 m away, it can reach 5–15 {mSv}. The dose in all downwind directions can drop below 250 {mSv} within 60 m. In path planning, results reveal the program is capable of accurately and efficiently calculating the minimum dose evacuation route. The program’s path reduces the effective dose by up to 67.3\% compared to the shortest route, enhancino safety, and guiding post-accident decision making and planning.},

	abstract = {The Lower Rio Grande Valley has historically faced a variety of hurricanes and tropical storms that have led to sever flooding. As a consequence, waves of mass evacuation of the local population with the means of transportation occur frequently. While evacuation is encouraged in some cases of disaster, the routing is not always available as water takes to roads and drainage capacities are overwhelmed. In order to dissert the most appropriate evacuation routes, it is necessary to analyze the areas that will be affected in the future based on urban locations, elevation, and historical information. This project utilizes a semi-coupled hydrodynamic modeling approach that combines the overall spectrum of hurricane storm surge and rainfall induced flooding. The combination of models provide data that can be analyzed with Geographical Information Systems to illustrate the severity of flooding. This analysis can be used to denote the location of the affected evacuation routes and an estimation of population affected in various storm scenarios. The estimated results of this project can be used to not only plan future evacuation routes but denote what areas will possibly require road maintenance after certain flooding scenarios.},

	abstract = {The optimization of evacuation routes for evacuees in fire scenarios on cruise ships directly affects evacuation efficiency. A time-varying equivalent weight Dijkstra algorithm ({TVEWDA}) is proposed, combining a fire dynamics simulator ({FDS}) to find optimal evacuation routes in case of a sudden cruise ship fire. First, the {FDS} software is used to simulate a cruise ship's single and multi-source fire scenarios. Second, the Dijkstra algorithm using only distance between nodes is improved by considering the effects of {CO} concentration, visibility, and temperature. The evacuees’ speed is taken into consideration within the {TVEWDA}. The effects of congestion are considered in the evacuees’ moving speed. Finally, the {TVEWDA} and a cruise ship evacuation network model are integrated to develop a real-time evacuation route optimization model. Simulation results show that the evacuation time achieved by the {TVEWDA} is 22\% shorter than that of the Dijkstra algorithm using only distance between nodes and 11\% shorter than that of an improved social force model in the multi-source fire scenario. This approach is well-suited to guide the evacuation of cruise ship evacuees in the event of single-source or multi-source fires, effectively ensuring the safety of passengers and the preservation of their property.},

	abstract = {The extent of casualty and property loss due to chemical accidents depends on how well the emergency action plan was established in advance and how fast the warning notice and evacuation orders are given to the public. Assistant methods for the establishment of protective action plans have been developed for several decades. However, the currently developed decision trees are complicated, so they may require a detailed analysis, and previous decision matrices do not consider the indoor and outdoor concentration directly and hence do not allow a change in evacuation order. In this study, five key parameters, report time, toxic cloud arrival/removal time and indoor/outdoor concentration, are selected for the evacuation decision, and the effectiveness of leakage and wind speed on five parameters is investigated. {CFD} simulations are performed for the various values of mass flow rate and wind speed. Near the release point of toxic gas, the maximum concentration is unaffected by wind speed, but the mass flow rate significantly influences it at low wind speeds. In the far field, the maximum concentration decreases with increasing wind speed. The termination time for shelter-in-place, suggesting a shift to evacuation, decreases with both higher mass flow rate and wind speed. For smaller mass flow rates (m˙=0.1kg/s), indoor concentration exceeds outdoor levels after 25.9 min, while for larger mass flow rates (m˙=2.0kg/s), this time shortens to 15.2 min. Increasing wind speed from 0.5 m/s to 5.0 m/s decreases the equilibrium concentration from 13.9 ppm to 3.4 ppm and reduces the escape time from 48.9 min to 16.0 min. Overall, higher mass flow rates and wind speeds shorten the equilibrium and escape times, improving toxic cloud removal efficiency. Based on the simulation results, a new evacuation decision matrix is developed which minimizes the total exposure concentration. This study provides the proper evacuation time along distance which eventually prevents traffic congestion because of the simultaneous escape rush.},

In a crowded chemical industrial park, heavy casualties and serious economic losses may be incurred in a toxic gas leak accident. Accordingly, the location of emergency shelters and occupant escape routes in chemical parks during gas leakage accidents were examined in this study. Additionally, the risk of leakage in chemical parks throughout the year was assessed by selecting the average values of wind direction, wind speed and temperature across four seasons, and criteria for selecting emergency shelters were set according to the minimum risk of toxic gas leakage throughout the year. Moreover, a 30,000 t/a carbon-five separation construction project was adopted as a case study, where instantaneous leakage of an auxiliary raw material liquid ammonia storage tank occurred. The Floyd algorithm was then used to calculate the evacuation paths for people at multiple sources and multiple endpoints. The influence of the dynamic diffusion of toxic gas around the leakage source point on evacuation route safety was thoroughly analyzed, and occupant evacuation plans were employed in the chemical park based on the shortest evacuation path with the least impact from toxic gases. The findings produced by this study may provide reliable technical support guidance for safety evacuation in regard to toxic gas leakage accidents for personnel in chemical industry parks.},

	abstract = {In the event of a large-scale toxic gas incident in an urbanized area, the mass evacuation of people located in the affected area is a highly challenging yet essential measure. We formulate a two-phase agent-based evacuation simulation model informed by real data from the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction ({NCDR}) in Taiwan and Aerial Location of Hazardous Atmosphere ({ALOHA}) software which can be leveraged by disaster management decision makers to bolster preparation and response mechanisms in the context of a toxic gas incident. Both phases of the evacuation simulation framework utilize agent-based rules tailored to manage the risk related to a toxic gas incident. Phase 1 is designed to realistically simulate the movement of pedestrian agents through a cell-based road network from their location in the hot zone or warm zone to a pre-determined set of assembly points to which high capacity public vehicles are dispatched. In Phase 2, the public vehicles also follow natural agent-based rules to select a shelter destination located outside the affected area and then to traverse through the cellular road network from assembly point to shelter. To pre-select an efficacious set of assembly points to be utilized in the event of an actual evacuation, a heuristic based on the k-means clustering algorithm is designed and implemented. We applied our two-phase agent-based evacuation simulation framework to carry out an empirical study based on a hypothetical massive toxic gas incident in an industrial zone in a large Taiwanese city. The empirical study looks at the effect of several model parameters on the evacuation simulation process, including the choice of assembly point arrangement. Compared to the current government policy, the proposed assembly point arrangement is shown to respectively decrease the average Phase 1 and Phase 2 evacuation times by 22\% and 13\%, which can be critical in reducing or preventing exposure to harmful levels of toxic gas.},

Traditional indoor fire evacuation methods often do not fully account for individual scenario differences, dynamic environments, and their impact on evacuation behavior, leading to evacuation routes that lack flexibility and real-time responsiveness. This study introduces a real-time mapping method driven by a knowledge graph and large language model. The method combines an indoor fire knowledge graph with ant colony algorithms, enabling real-time perception of fire dynamics to generate personalized evacuation route maps and guidance. A prototype system is developed and subjected to experimental analysis. The experimental results show that this system significantly outperforms the standard {LLM} in handling indoor fire-related information. Moreover, in evacuation simulation experiments, participants using this system experienced a 27.41\% increase in evacuation efficiency, and a significant decrease in anxiety levels. This approach effectively enhances the public's ability to respond to emergencies during indoor fires.

Taxi-based mobile pollutant monitoring data in Cangzhou city, China, were applied to provide a high-resolution concentration map. We found that exposure varied throughout the day and seasons due to traffic, coal usage, and meteorology. Results show that exercising travelers may avoid 16.8\% of exposure experienced by commuting travelers when choosing a route with low exposure but long detours. Because of the lower travel speed, even when taking a low-exposure route, middle-aged and elderly may suffer 22.9\% and 10.7\% higher exposure, respectively, than younger travelers. These might lead to health inequity related to transportation investment or policies.},
